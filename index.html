                    <h3>Gerard Gallego</h3>
                    <span class="team-role">Founder & CEO</span>
                    <p>The visionary mastermind behind Gallego Travel Inc. Gerard founded this company after realizing that making travel decisions is overrated. When he's not revolutionizing the travel industry, he can be found convincing people that Barcelona is the center of the universe. His motto: "Why plan when you can be surprised?"</p>

                    <p>The person who actually makes sure things work around here. Alex handles operations and finances, which mostly means telling Gerard that no, we cannot offer free trips to everyone. With a background in "keeping things from falling apart," Alex ensures that your surprise destinations are at least somewhat within budget. Probably.</p>
